Orderbook is being realized with the help of self balancing binary search tree since 
the main goal is to have fast operations when updating (inserting/deletion of orders)
and to have easy access to the biggest/smallest bid/ask.

Template typing is used when creating the classes used in the proposed solution with the idea of
nevertheless the received data would be of type double, due to that operations with double are perfomed
by the FPU and are more costly than the simple integer operations, the Orderbook could be created and managed
as of Orders of unsigned integer with the size of 8 bytes by this we improve the average speed performance.


Different Orderbooks could be created for each of the different symbol pairs in the binance exchange
and external logic will be needed to be deciding after receiving the event which orderbook to be fuilfilled.


Time complexity for inserting and deletion is O(log n).
Time complexity for getting max/min element is currently O(log n) which
could be reduced to constant if we have 2 more pointers which to be updated 
with each insertion/deletion.


In Tests.cpp are both realized Unit testing and latency benchmark testing.
